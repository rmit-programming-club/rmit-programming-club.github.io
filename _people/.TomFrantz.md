I am a stock standard third year BH094 Bachelor of Computer Science Student, and I am the Vice-President of the RMIT Programming Club.

I've been programming since about year 11 in high school, and I've loved every moment of it. 
I like to think of myself a a turbo nerd, of course. Here are some of the things I truly enjoy:

 - Python (Team Dynamic, baby)
 - Javascript, Typescript, and React. There's just so much you can do with it.
 - GraphQL and other emerging technologies
 - Rust (as a hobby, I really wanna know more though!)
 - All the domains of computer science. I was really into compilers for a while here or there.

He'll know it's from me, with love <3
