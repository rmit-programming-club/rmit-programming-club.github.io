I am a first year IT Student at RMIT(city campus) and I will be graduating in 2021.

I am the main developer of [Firefly III Mobile](https://github.com/emansih/FireflyMobile), the open source mobile wrapper for Firefly III and 
this is where many of my open source contributions go. I also give feedback to Firefly III's API from time to time.  

I am interested in the following:
- Java
- Kotlin
- Sysadmin
