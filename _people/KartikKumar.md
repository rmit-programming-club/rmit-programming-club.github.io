Third Year Software Engineering student currently doing my internship year. I love everything Software. My expertise lies in Cloud Architecture and Software Design. My believe is all programming language are good except..
I live-stream coding session on Twitch and Youtube. I will debate you on any programming controversy. Always happy to have a chat and you'd see me on campus a lot
