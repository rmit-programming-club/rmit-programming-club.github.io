This is the first post on RMIT Programming Club's new website. This blog feed will contain all event news, meeting minutes, and project updates for the club.

## The New RMIT Programming Club
-----

Unfortunately, the old RMIT Programming Club died, most likely from a leadership break down. The new club, version 2016, will pick up the slack so that programmers at RMIT will always have a community to join, a place where they can learn, meet people, and challenge themselves.

Away we go.
